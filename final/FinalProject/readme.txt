This program is very fragile because I don't have time to handle all user input errors.
So, if your input is not the type that the program wants then the program would crash.

Here are the guides to use this program without crashing:
- If you need to choose an option then just input the number in front of the option.
- If you want to add some new object in "Data Setting", then make sure to input a number when it is a "Box", like the hint in the system.

I have created some data in all txt files as an example.
